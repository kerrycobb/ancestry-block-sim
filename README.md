# ancestry-block-sim
Tool to simulate recombination of different ancestries

# TODO:
  In order of priority
  1. write a output file to numpy matrix parser in python
  2. Calculate proportion ancestry - Kerry
  2. procs to compute block length range, std, and mean
  3. plot junctions in ggplot
  4. how to calculate block length and junction number expectations
  5. procs to compute centimorgans given the haplotype length and recombination probabilities
